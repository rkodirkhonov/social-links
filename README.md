## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I strengthened my understanding of Flexbox for layout purposes. I also improved at making responsive designs that adjust smoothly from mobile to desktop sizes.

Example of my favorite HTML snippet:

```html
<a href="#" class="big-button">GitHub</a>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus more on improving accessibility features, such as better keyboard navigation and screen reader support. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS Grid, to further enhance my layout designs.
